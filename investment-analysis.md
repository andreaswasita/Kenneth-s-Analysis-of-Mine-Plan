## Bull Case (Reasons TO Invest)

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Mine life** | 24 years mining + 4 years tail processing = ~28 years of production. Exceptional longevity. |
| **Production stability** | Concentrate output remarkably flat at 1.6–2.0 Mt/yr for 20+ years. Predictable cashflows. |
| **World-class asset** | Greenbushes is the largest hard-rock lithium mine globally. Tier-1, irreplaceable. |
| **4-plant infrastructure** | CGP1, CGP2, CGP3, TGP — diversified processing reduces single-point-of-failure risk. |
| **Lithium macro tailwind** | EV penetration, grid storage, and energy transition drive structural demand growth through 2050. |
| **Grade quality** | ~2.0% Li₂O average is competitive for hard-rock. Higher-grade earlier years front-load value. |

## Bear Case (Reasons NOT to Invest)

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **2034 capex cliff** | Strip ratio hits 11.5x — moving 75 Mt total for just 6 Mt ore. Massive cost year. Free cashflow likely negative. |
| **Grade degradation** | Li₂O drops from 2.22% (2030 peak) to 1.19% (2050). Higher cost per tonne of concentrate in tail years. |
| **No underground optionality** | LoM explicitly excludes underground feed. Mine life is finite with no extension pathway shown. |
| **Post-2048 collapse** | Concentrate drops from 1.9 Mt → 0.4 → 0.1 Mt. Rapid terminal decline. |
| **Lithium price risk** | Lithium has shown extreme volatility (2022: $80k/t → 2024: $12k/t). Entire thesis depends on price recovery/stability. |
| **Single commodity** | 100% lithium exposure. No diversification hedge. |
| **Stockpile execution risk** | Plan relies on drawing down 23.4 Mt of stockpiles over 20 years. Grade/quality assumptions for stockpiled ore may not hold. |

## Key Financial Dynamics

| Phase | Period | Characteristics |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Early years** | 2026–2032 | HIGH ore output, HIGH grades, BUILDING stockpiles → Likely strongest cashflow period |
| **Mid-life** | 2032–2038 | MASSIVE waste stripping campaign (2034 peak) → Capex-heavy, margin compression |
| **Mature** | 2038–2048 | Declining movement, stable processing → Steady but diminishing returns |
| **Tail** | 2050–2053 | Stockpile feed only, low grades → Marginal economics, likely cash-negative at low prices |

## Critical Data Points

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Ore (even-year snapshots) | ~92 Mt |
| Total Waste (even-year snapshots) | ~398 Mt |
| Average Strip Ratio | ~4.3 (waste:ore) |
| Peak Strip Ratio | 11.5 in 2034 |
| Peak Stockpile | 23.4 Mt in 2032 |
| Average Li₂O Grade | ~1.98% |
| Peak Li₂O Grade | 2.22% in 2030 |
| Lowest Li₂O Grade | 1.19% in 2050 |
| Steady-state concentrate output | 1.6–2.0 Mt/yr |
| Processing capacity | ~7–8 Mt/yr across 4 plants |

## Verdict

| | |
|---|---|
| **Investable?** | **Conditionally YES** — but entry price and lithium price outlook are everything. |
| **Risk rating** | **Medium-High** |
| **Time horizon** | Must be 10+ year patient capital |
| **Key trigger** | The 2034 waste stripping campaign is the make-or-break year. If lithium prices are low during that period, IGO will burn significant cash on a 11.5:1 strip ratio. |

## What I'd Want Before Committing Capital

1. **Lithium price sensitivity model** — What spodumene price makes the 2034 stripping campaign NPV-positive?
2. **Unit cost data** — $/t operating cost for mining + processing to calculate breakeven
3. **Underground feasibility** — Any studies on extending mine life beyond 2049?
4. **Off-take agreements** — Are concentrate sales locked in at favourable prices?
5. **Balance sheet** — Can IGO fund the 2034 peak capex without dilutive equity raises?
6. **JV structure** — IGO's actual ownership % of Greenbushes (Tianqi JV) affects net economics

---

## Bottom Line

> Greenbushes is a world-class asset with a long, stable production profile. The risk is concentrated around the **2034 waste stripping campaign** and **lithium price**. As a fund manager, I'd invest on a significant price dip (entry price matters enormously), with a 10-year hold thesis, and I'd hedge lithium exposure. I would **NOT** invest at a premium valuation given the 2034 capex risk and grade decline trajectory.
